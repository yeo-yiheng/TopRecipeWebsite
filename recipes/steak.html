        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Steak is a food that can be described as tender, flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection; in fact,
             most consumers describe their ideal steak as just that: "A tender, flavorful, medium-rare steak that
              isn't overly salty." "Tender, juicy, cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned." "Cooked to perfection."</p>
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Steak</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh Thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
           <li><strong>Bring to room temp!</strong> This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
           <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</li>
           <li>Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
           <li><strong>WARNING:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
           <li>Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE</strong> your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</li>
           <li><strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
        </ol>
